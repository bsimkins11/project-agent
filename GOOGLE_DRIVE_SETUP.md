# Google Drive Access Setup Guide

## Overview

The Project Deliverable Agent uses **Admin-Controlled Document Access**. Admins manually select documents from Google Drive folders they have access to, and these documents are queued for approval before vectorization.

## üîß Simple Setup Process

### 1. Admin Access Required

- Admin must be logged into the Project Deliverable Agent
- Admin must have access to the Google Drive folders they want to search
- No service account configuration needed

### 2. Document Selection Process

1. **Admin goes to Drive Search tab**
2. **Pastes Google Drive folder URL** (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC123def456`)
3. **System shows documents** in that folder
4. **Admin selects documents** to add to approval queue
5. **Selected documents** are queued for admin approval
6. **Approved documents** get vectorized and become searchable

### 3. Supported Drive URLs

The system accepts:
- Full Google Drive folder URLs: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC123def456`
- Folder IDs only: `1ABC123def456`
- Automatically extracts folder ID from URLs
