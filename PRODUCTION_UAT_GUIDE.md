## üîí RBAC Security Testing (Once Backend Deployed)

### **Test 7: User Role Separation**

**Setup Required:**
1. Create test users via Admin API:
   - Super Admin
   - Account Admin for Client A
   - Project Admin for Project 1
   - End User for Projects 1-2

**Test Scenarios:**

#### **7.1 Super Admin Access**
```bash
# Should have unrestricted access
curl https://project-agent-admin-api-xxx.run.app/admin/rbac/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN"

Expected: Returns ALL clients
```

#### **7.2 Account Admin Restrictions**
```bash
# Should see only assigned client
curl https://project-agent-admin-api-xxx.run.app/admin/rbac/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_ADMIN_TOKEN"

Expected: Returns ONLY assigned client
```

#### **7.3 Project Admin Restrictions**
```bash
# Should NOT be able to create clients
curl -X POST https://project-agent-admin-api-xxx.run.app/admin/rbac/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_ADMIN_TOKEN"

Expected: 403 Forbidden - "Permission required: client:manage"
```

#### **7.4 End User Restrictions**
```bash
# Should NOT access admin endpoints
curl https://project-agent-admin-api-xxx.run.app/admin/rbac/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $END_USER_TOKEN"

Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

---

### **Test 8: Document Access Control**

**Test Scenarios:**

#### **8.1 Project Boundary Enforcement**
```bash
# User assigned to Project 1 tries to access Project 2 document
curl https://project-agent-documents-api-xxx.run.app/documents/project2-doc-123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT1_USER_TOKEN"

Expected: 403 Forbidden - "Access denied to document"
```

#### **8.2 Inventory Filtering**
```bash
# User assigned to Projects 1-2 gets inventory
curl https://project-agent-inventory-api-xxx.run.app/inventory \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT12_USER_TOKEN"

Expected: Returns ONLY documents from Projects 1 & 2
```

---

### **Test 9: AI Chat Information Isolation** üîí **CRITICAL**

**Test Scenarios:**

#### **9.1 Cross-Project Information Leakage**
```bash
# Setup:
# - User A: Access to Project 1 (Budget: $500k)
# - Project 2 exists (Budget: $1M) but user has NO access

# Test:
curl -X POST https://project-agent-chat-api-xxx.run.app/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_A_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the budget?"}'

# Expected:
# Answer: "Budget is $500k" (Project 1 ONLY)
# Citations: [Project 1 documents only]

# CRITICAL:
# Answer should NOT mention Project 2's $1M budget
# Citations should NOT include Project 2 documents
```

#### **9.2 Cross-Client Information Leakage**
```bash
# Setup:
# - User: Account Admin for Client A
# - Client B exists with sensitive data

# Test:
curl -X POST https://project-agent-chat-api-xxx.run.app/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLIENT_A_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Show me all revenue numbers"}'

# Expected:
# Answer: Contains ONLY Client A revenue
# Citations: ONLY Client A documents

# CRITICAL:
# No mention of Client B anywhere in response
```

---

### **Test 10: Upload Permissions**

```bash
# End User tries to upload (should fail)
curl -X POST https://project-agent-upload-api-xxx.run.app/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $END_USER_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"

Expected: 403 Forbidden - "Permission required: document:upload"

# Project Admin uploads (should succeed)
curl -X POST https://project-agent-upload-api-xxx.run.app/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROJECT_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"

Expected: 200 OK with document ID
```

## üö® Critical Security Validation

### **MUST VERIFY:**

‚úÖ **Information Isolation Test**
```
Query: "Show me all projects and their budgets"

User A (Project 1 only):
  ‚úÖ Answer mentions ONLY Project 1
  ‚úÖ NO mention of other projects
  ‚úÖ Citations from Project 1 only

User B (Projects 2-3):
  ‚úÖ Answer mentions ONLY Projects 2-3
  ‚úÖ NO mention of Project 1
  ‚úÖ Citations from Projects 2-3 only
```

This is the **#1 critical security requirement** - users must NEVER see information from clients/projects they don't have access to.

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**UAT Passes If:**
- ‚úÖ All UI changes are visible
- ‚úÖ All user roles work correctly
- ‚úÖ Security boundaries are enforced
- ‚úÖ No information leakage in AI answers
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in logs

**UAT Fails If:**
- ‚ùå User can access other clients' data
- ‚ùå User can access other projects' data
- ‚ùå AI answer mentions inaccessible information
- ‚ùå Permission checks can be bypassed
- ‚ùå Critical functionality broken

---

## üìû Next Steps After UAT

### **If UAT Passes:** ‚úÖ
1. Mark Phase 5 as complete
2. Deploy backend services with RBAC
3. Run full test suite in production
4. Enable monitoring and alerts
5. Train users on new features
6. Go live!

### **If UAT Fails:** ‚ùå
1. Document all issues
2. Prioritize by severity
3. Fix critical issues
4. Re-deploy
5. Re-test
6. Repeat until pass

---

## üîç Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Watch:**

**Where to Monitor:**
- Cloud Run Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=transparent-agent-test
- Logs: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?project=transparent-agent-test

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Deployed:** Web Portal with UI improvements  
**Ready for UAT:** Front-end changes  
**Next:** Deploy backend services with RBAC  
**Then:** Full production UAT testing
