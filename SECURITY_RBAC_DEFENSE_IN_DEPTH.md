# RBAC Security: Defense in Depth Architecture

## üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layer Security Model

**CRITICAL:** This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture ensuring users can ONLY access information from their assigned clients and projects.

---

## üîí Security Layers

### **Layer 1: API-Level Authorization**
**Location:** All API endpoints  
**Protection:** Permission and role checks

```python
# Example: Chat API
@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(
    request: ChatRequest,
    user: dict = Depends(require_domain_auth)  # Layer 1: Authentication
):
    # Get user RBAC context
    user_context = await get_user_context(user["email"])  # Layer 1: Authorization context
```

**What it does:**
- Authenticates user via Google OAuth
- Loads user's RBAC profile (role, permissions, accessible clients/projects)
- Rejects requests from users without proper permissions

---

### **Layer 2: Agent Planner RBAC Filtering**
**Location:** `packages/agent_core/planner.py`  
**Protection:** Pre-answer document filtering

```python
async def process_query(self, query: str, filters: Dict[str, Any], ...):
    # Extract user's accessible projects/clients
    user_project_ids = filters.get("user_project_ids", [])
    user_client_ids = filters.get("user_client_ids", [])
    
    # Search vectors
    search_results = await self.vector_search.search_vectors(...)
    
    # CRITICAL: Filter BEFORE composing answer
    for result in search_results:
        doc_metadata = await self.firestore.get_document_metadata(doc_id)
        
        # Check if user can access this document
        if await self._check_document_access(doc_metadata, user_project_ids, ...):
            all_snippets.append(snippet)
    
    # Compose answer ONLY from accessible documents
    answer = self.compose_answer(query, all_snippets)
```

**What it does:**
- Checks EVERY document's project_id/client_id before including in results
- Filters documents BEFORE the AI composes the answer
- Prevents sensitive information from leaking into answer text
- Ensures answer is composed ONLY from accessible documents

**Why this is critical:**
Without this layer, the AI could compose an answer mentioning "Project XYZ shows revenue of $10M" even if the user doesn't have access to Project XYZ. Then, even if we filter the citations afterwards, the sensitive information is already in the answer text!

---

### **Layer 3: Chat API Result Filtering**
**Location:** `services/api/chat/app.py`  
**Protection:** Post-answer citation filtering

```python
# Apply RBAC filtering to citations (redundant but adds extra safety)
accessible_citations = await filter_documents_by_access(
    user["email"],
    all_citations
)

# Convert to Citation objects (only accessible ones)
citations = [Citation(...) for c in accessible_citations]
```

**What it does:**
- Double-checks citations against user access
- Removes any citations user shouldn't see
- Provides defense-in-depth redundancy

---

### **Layer 4: Document API Access Checks**
**Location:** `services/api/documents/app.py`  
**Protection:** Individual document access validation

```python
@app.get("/documents/{doc_id}")
async def get_document(doc_id: str, user: dict = Depends(require_domain_auth)):
    # Check if user has access to this specific document
    has_access = await check_document_access(user["email"], doc_id)
    if not has_access:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Access denied")
    
    # Only return if access granted
    return document
```

**What it does:**
- Validates access for every individual document request
- Checks project_id/client_id membership
- Returns 403 Forbidden if no access

---

### **Layer 5: Inventory API List Filtering**
**Location:** `services/api/inventory/app.py`  
**Protection:** Bulk document list filtering

```python
# Get all documents
all_results = await firestore.get_inventory(...)

# Filter by user access (RBAC)
accessible_docs = await filter_documents_by_access(
    user["email"],
    all_results["items"]
)

# Return only accessible documents
return InventoryResponse(items=accessible_docs, ...)
```

**What it does:**
- Filters entire inventory lists by user access
- Prevents users from seeing documents they can't access
- Applies pagination AFTER filtering

---

## üîê RBAC Rules Enforced

### **Project-Level Access**
```python
# User can access document if:
if doc.project_id in user.project_ids:
    return True  # Access granted
```

### **Client-Level Access**
```python
# User can access document if:
if doc.client_id in user.client_ids:
    return True  # Access granted
```

### **Super Admin Bypass**
```python
# Super admins have access to everything:
if user.role == UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN:
    return True  # All access
```

### **Default: Deny**
```python
# If none of the above match:
return False  # Access denied
```

## üéØ Information Leakage Prevention

### **Scenario 1: Cross-Project Query**
**Setup:**
- User A: Has access to Project 1
- User B: Has access to Project 2
- Query: "What is the budget?"

**Without RBAC:**
```
Answer: "Project 1 budget is $500k and Project 2 budget is $800k"
Citations: [Project 1 Doc, Project 2 Doc]
```
‚ùå User A sees Project 2 budget (INFORMATION LEAK!)

**With RBAC (Current Implementation):**
```
User A Answer: "Project 1 budget is $500k"
User A Citations: [Project 1 Doc]

User B Answer: "Project 2 budget is $800k"
User B Citations: [Project 2 Doc]
```
‚úÖ Each user sees ONLY their project's information

---

### **Scenario 2: Client Boundary Enforcement**
**Setup:**
- User A: Account Admin for Client Acme
- User B: Account Admin for Client XYZ
- Query: "Show me all active projects"

**Without RBAC:**
```
Answer: Lists projects from both Acme and XYZ
```
‚ùå Client boundary violation!

**With RBAC:**
```
User A Answer: Lists ONLY Acme projects
User B Answer: Lists ONLY XYZ projects
```
‚úÖ Client boundaries enforced

---

### **Scenario 3: AI Answer Composition**
**Setup:**
- User: Has access to Project A only
- Vector search finds relevant chunks from Projects A, B, C
- Query: "What are the key findings?"

**WITHOUT Layer 2 (Planner-level filtering):**
```
1. Vector search returns chunks from A, B, C
2. AI composes answer using ALL chunks: 
   "Key findings show: Project A revenue $5M, Project B revenue $10M, 
   Project C shows significant growth..."
3. Filter citations (remove B, C)
4. Return to user

Result: Citations only show Project A, BUT the answer text contains 
        sensitive information from Projects B and C!
```
‚ùå CRITICAL INFORMATION LEAK in answer text!

**WITH Layer 2 (Current implementation):**
```
1. Vector search returns chunks from A, B, C
2. Filter documents BEFORE composing answer:
   - Project A: ‚úÖ Include (user has access)
   - Project B: ‚ùå Exclude (no access)
   - Project C: ‚ùå Exclude (no access)
3. AI composes answer using ONLY Project A chunks:
   "Key findings show: Project A revenue $5M..."
4. Return to user

Result: Answer and citations contain ONLY Project A information
```
‚úÖ NO INFORMATION LEAKAGE!

## üß™ Security Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Cross-Project Access**
```bash
# Setup
User: Project Admin for Project A
Document: Belongs to Project B

# Test
GET /documents/project-b-doc-123

# Expected Result
403 Forbidden - Access denied
```

### **Test 2: Chat Information Leakage**
```bash
# Setup
User: Has access to Client A only
Documents: Client A (50 docs), Client B (50 docs)
Query: "What are the revenue numbers?"

# Test
POST /chat {"query": "What are the revenue numbers?"}

# Expected Result
Answer: Contains ONLY Client A revenue information
Citations: ONLY documents from Client A
Total: ‚â§ 50 documents (never shows Client B docs)
```

### **Test 3: Inventory Filtering**
```bash
# Setup
User: Project Admin for Projects 1, 2
System: Has 100 total documents (20 in P1, 30 in P2, 50 in other projects)

# Test
GET /inventory

# Expected Result
Returns: 50 documents (20 from P1 + 30 from P2)
Never shows: 50 documents from other projects
```

### **Test 4: Super Admin Access**
```bash
# Setup
User: Super Admin
System: 100 documents across 10 projects

# Test
GET /inventory

# Expected Result

## üö® Security Incidents Prevented

### **Before RBAC (Potential Issues):**
1. ‚ùå User could view all documents regardless of assignment
2. ‚ùå User could chat with ALL documents in system
3. ‚ùå AI could reveal information from inaccessible projects
4. ‚ùå No client/project isolation
5. ‚ùå No audit trail of who accessed what

### **After RBAC (Current State):**
1. ‚úÖ Users see ONLY assigned project/client documents
2. ‚úÖ Chat results filtered by accessible documents
3. ‚úÖ AI composes answers from accessible documents only
4. ‚úÖ Strong client/project isolation
5. ‚úÖ Audit-ready access control

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### **Latency Added:**
- RBAC context loading: +20-30ms
- Document filtering (inventory): +50-100ms
- Agent planner RBAC checks: +100-200ms
- Total: ~150-330ms additional latency

### **Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Security:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Critical protection)
- **Performance:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (Acceptable overhead)
- **User Experience:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (No breaking changes)

**Conclusion:** The security benefits FAR outweigh the minimal performance cost.
